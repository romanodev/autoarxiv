# autoarxiv

AutoArXiv is a tool to submit manuscripts to arXiv without interacting with a broswer. You'll need an arXiv username (your email), the arXiv password and a zip file containing at least a *.tex file. Lastly, you'll need Chromedriver in your PATH. The manuscript will be sumbitted once you are asked so at the end of the process. 

Submit paper to arXiv. Make it sure that Chromedriver is in your PATH
